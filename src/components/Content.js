      <p>Once upon a time, there was a lion napping in the dangerous jungle and a mouse trying to pass by him without getting caught.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the lion wakes up, catches the mouse and was set to gobble him up. The mouse begged the lion not to eat him stating "if you show me kindness now, one day I will show you kindness in return.</p>
      <p>The lion laughed because what could a small mouse do for him. However, feeling generous, he let the mouse go.</p>
      <p>Later, the lion accidently steps on a thorn and his big paws can't remove it or relieve the pain</p>
      <p>The mouse hears the lion's cries and pulls the thorn out of the lion's paw, repaying back his kindness like he said!</p>
